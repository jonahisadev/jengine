For Ludum Dare:
  ☐ Large refactorizations
    ✔ Instead of std::function, have a BaseGame class to inherit from @done(20-09-17 17:37)
    ✔ Remove bad usage of smart pointers @done(20-09-17 18:41)
    ✔ Unify syntax @done(20-09-17 19:31)
    ✘ Default constructors for things that may not immediately be initialized @cancelled(20-09-18 11:53)
    ☐ Abstract Quad and things better
    Perhaps do this in conjunction with Spritesheets
  ✔ Cycles @done(20-09-21 19:38)
  ✔ Timer / Interval @done(20-09-21 20:08)
  ✔ Cycle loops @done(20-09-21 20:08)
  ☐ Playlists
  ✔ MP3 support @done(20-09-19 19:28)
  ☐ Controller + Keyboard abstraction
  ☐ Get Windows working reliably

Graphics:
  ☐ Specify mesh rotation point
  ☐ Fonts are blurry when scaled, try and fix this
  ✔ Allow textures to be displayed without GL_NEAREST @done(19-10-12 12:43)
  ✔ Quads should translate to a vector in addition to coordinates @done(19-10-12 17:35)
  ✔ Eventually move to OpenGL 3 @done(19-11-02 14:01)
  ✔ Allow cursor replacement @done(19-10-03 00:43)
  ✔ Anti-aliasing? @done(19-10-03 00:02)
  ✔ Add more window positioning @done(19-10-25 00:48)
    ✔ Set position @done(19-10-25 00:48)
    ✔ Center function @done(19-10-25 00:48)
  ☐ Scenes
  ☐ Cameras (related to Scenes)
  ☐ Lighting
  ✔ Group of text (mutli-line) @done(19-11-06 19:32)
  ☐ Animations
    ✔ Linear animations @done(20-01-21 08:06)
    ✔ Absolute & relative animations @done(20-01-21 14:18)
    ✔ Single var animations @done(20-01-21 11:34)
    ☐ Curved animations
    ☐ List of animations
  ☐ Scaling option
  This is useful for scaling all the graphics when the window is resized

Game:
  ✔ Resource Loader @done(20-01-18 12:33)
  This is useful for abstracting loads across platforms
  ☐ Some sort of utility to generate things
  Create a tool to generate projects, executables, builds, etc.
  ✔ Better application logging @done(19-11-06 19:07)
  ☐ Maybe have the Game class be a wrapper
  This could handle some default things like a default font, scene,
  logger, window, etc.

Audio:
  ✔ Looping @done(20-01-18 09:42)
  ✔ Pause, play, stop @done(20-01-18 10:57)
  ✔ Basic lowpass @done(20-01-18 10:57)
  ☐ More control over filters
  ☐ OGG support

Math:
  ☐ More vector operations
  ☐ Vector4

Other:
  ☐ Restructure again for vendor and src directories
  ✔ Mouse and Key macros @done(19-10-08 18:10)
  ✔ Mouse and key press once checking @done(19-10-08 18:10)
  ☐ Some sort of base UI system?
  We at least need some sort of text input
  ☐ Implement plenty of overloads

Bugs:
  ☐ [Mac](Audio): OpenAL errors on close
