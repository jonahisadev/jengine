Graphics:
  ☐ Better spritesheet support
  Do we maybe want to have a Sprite class where we have multiple
  sprites that all inherit from the same spritesheet?
  ☐ Eventually move to OpenGL 3
  ✔ Allow cursor replacement @done(19-10-03 00:43)
  ✔ Anti-aliasing? @done(19-10-03 00:02)
  ☐ Specify mesh rotation point

Audio:
  ☐ Looping
  ☐ Pause, play, stop

Math:
  ☐ More vector operations
  ☐ Vector4

Other:
  ☐ Restructure again for vendor and src directories
  ☐ Mouse and Key macros
  ☐ Some sort of base UI system?
  We at least need some sort of text input
