Graphics:
  ☐ Specify mesh rotation point
  ☐ Fonts are blurry when scaled, try and fix this
  ✔ Allow textures to be displayed without GL_NEAREST @done(19-10-12 12:43)
  ✔ Quads should translate to a vector in addition to coordinates @done(19-10-12 17:35)
  ☐ Better spritesheet support
  Do we maybe want to have a Sprite class where we have multiple
  sprites that all inherit from the same spritesheet?
  ✔ Eventually move to OpenGL 3 @done(19-11-02 14:01)
  ✔ Allow cursor replacement @done(19-10-03 00:43)
  ✔ Anti-aliasing? @done(19-10-03 00:02)
  ✔ Add more window positioning @done(19-10-25 00:48)
    ✔ Set position @done(19-10-25 00:48)
    ✔ Center function @done(19-10-25 00:48)
  ☐ Scenes
  ☐ Cameras (related to Scenes)
  ☐ Lighting
  ✔ Group of text (mutli-line) @done(19-11-06 19:32)
  ☐ Animations

Game:
  ☐ Resource Loader
  This is useful for abstracting loads across platforms
  ☐ Some sort of utility to generate things
  Create a tool to generate projects, executables, builds, etc.
  ✔ Better application logging @done(19-11-06 19:07)
  ☐ Maybe have the Game class be a wrapper
  This could handle some default things like a default font, scene,
  logger, window, etc.

Audio:
  ✔ Looping @done(20-01-18 09:42)
  ☐ Pause, play, stop

Math:
  ☐ More vector operations
  ☐ Vector4

Other:
  ☐ Restructure again for vendor and src directories
  ✔ Mouse and Key macros @done(19-10-08 18:10)
  ✔ Mouse and key press once checking @done(19-10-08 18:10)
  ☐ Some sort of base UI system?
  We at least need some sort of text input
  ☐ Font in TextGroup should be a const reference
  ☐ TexturedQuad position is wrong
